## Development Workflow

1. **Code Changes**

   - Follow existing code patterns
   - Run tests locally before committing

2. **Documentation**
   - Update relevant docs in /docs
   - Keep README.md high-level
   - Document technical details in /docs

3. **CI/CD**
   - CI runs on all PRs
   - Staging deploys from staging branch

## Testing Guidelines

- Unit tests with Jest
- E2E tests for critical flows
- Test offline behavior
- Verify cross-browser compatibility
