# OpenHands Instructions

## GitHub Actions Guidelines
- Do not modify GitHub Actions workflow files directly
- If workflow changes are needed, create new action files in the root directory
- Focus on modifying the scripts that actions call instead of the actions themselves

## Repository Structure
- Main application code is in `/src`
- Multiple app variants in `/apps` (web, mobile, chrome, firefox)
- Core packages in `/packages/core`
- Scripts for automation in `/scripts`

## Development Guidelines
1. When making code changes:
   - Ensure proper test coverage
   - Add tests in appropriate test directories
   - Run tests to verify changes

2. For configuration changes:
   - No tests required for documentation or config files
   - Maintain consistent formatting
   - Follow existing patterns

3. Script Modifications:
   - Scripts in `/scripts` can be modified as needed
   - Ensure backward compatibility
   - Add proper error handling

## Testing
- Jest is used for testing (see jest.config.js)
- E2E tests configuration in jest.e2e.config.js
- Run appropriate test suite before submitting changes

## Sync Functionality
1. Password-Based Sync:
   - All sync operations require a password
   - Password used for encryption and sync group identification
   - Never store passwords on server

2. Offline Support:
   - Extensions work offline by default
   - Changes queued locally when offline
   - Auto-sync every 5 minutes when online
   - Manual sync available via API

3. Security Requirements:
   - All data must be encrypted before transmission
   - Use AES encryption with password
   - No plaintext data in storage/transit
   - Separate sync groups by password

4. Testing Sync Changes:
   - Test offline behavior
   - Verify password changes
   - Check cross-platform sync
   - Validate encryption
