## Development Workflow

1. **Build Configuration**
   - Two separate webpack configurations for different purposes:
     - `webpack.config.js`: Builds the browser extension components
       - Handles background service worker, popup UI, and options page
       - Includes extension assets (manifest.json, HTML files, icons)
       - Outputs to `dist` directory
     - `webpack.worker.js`: Builds the Cloudflare Worker backend
       - Targets webworker environment
       - Single entry point for backend code
       - Outputs optimized ES module to `worker` directory

2. **Code Changes**
   - Write tests for new features using Vitest and Puppeteer
   - Follow TypeScript best practices and existing patterns
   - Run tests locally before committing:
     - Unit tests: `npm test`
     - Watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
     - E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`
   - Use ESLint for code quality (`npm run lint`)
   - Format code with Prettier (`npm run format`)

2. **Documentation and Screenshots**
   - Technical details go in /docs
   - Keep README.md focused on quick start and high-level overview
   - Document API changes in /docs/api.md
   - Update security model in /docs/security.md when relevant
   - Screenshots are automatically generated during E2E tests:
     - Never commit screenshots to the repository
     - Screenshots are stored as GitHub Actions artifacts
     - Deployed to chroniclesync.xyz via GitHub Pages
     - Always use https://chroniclesync.xyz/screenshots/... URLs in documentation

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Tests run on all PRs (GitHub Actions)
   - E2E tests generate screenshots and store as artifacts
   - Main branch merges trigger:
     - Staging deployment to Cloudflare
     - Screenshot deployment to chroniclesync.xyz
     - Documentation updates with latest test results
   - Production deploys from version tags (v*)
   - Monitor deployments in Cloudflare Dashboard

## Security Requirements

- End-to-end encryption using PBKDF2 key derivation
- All sync data encrypted before storage
- No plaintext data in Cloudflare storage (R2/D1/KV)
- Input validation on both client and worker
- Regular security audits of dependencies

## Deployment Process

1. **Staging**
   - Merges to main trigger staging deployment
   - Creates beta release on GitHub
   - Uses staging Cloudflare resources

2. **Production**
   - Tag a release (v*) for production deployment
   - Automated deployment to Cloudflare production
   - Creates GitHub release with changelog
   - Extension stores must be updated manually

## Version Control

- Feature branches from main
- PRs require passing tests and review
- Version tags follow semver (vX.Y.Z)
- Changelog updates required for releases
